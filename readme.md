It is data from the 2012 PISA study. It provides test scores of indivdual students and survey of background information of those students


## Summary of Findings

- Most students study Maths around 200 minutes per week
- Some students study up to 1000 minutes of Maths per week
- The best students have studied around 200 to 300 minutes of Maths per week.
- Students who study longer are better on average.
- The longer students study the better the minimum score for time studied gets.
- However the highest score for time studied also drops with more than 500 minutes per week
- The number of years of education of the parents has a positive influence on the test scores
- The education level of either parent has a positive influence on the test scores
- Both parents have the same amount of influence on the grade.
- Positive attitudes towards school correlate with better scores
- Negative attitudes towards school correlate with worse scores


## Key Insights for Presentation

Time studied has only a weak correlation with achieved scores, which suggests that the wisdom of "practice makes perfect" is not completely true for Maths. Although students to get better on average the more they study, the highest scores are achieved with 200 minutes of study per week compared to some students studying 1000 minutes.
